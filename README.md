DATS6101: Introduction to Data Science - Diamond Price Prediction Final Project

This is a repository for a diamonds price prediction model approach to the diamonds.csv datset, which was my final project for the Introduction to Data Science class in the Master of Science in Data Science at The George Washington University (GWU). All the code is on Final Project Submission RMD Diamonds.rmd, which utilizes the following modules:

NumPy
pandas
matplotlib.pyplot
and others...

Download this R Mark Down or clone the repository for full reproduction of the results. The repo also holds the project report and the project slides.

Happy Diamond Price Predicting!
